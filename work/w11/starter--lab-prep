## Starter lab prep

1. Go to your aws account and confirm what your buckets name, maybe its `catcollector` is and write it down, you'll need it for the lesson later on!

- Here is the [link](https://git.generalassemb.ly/SEI-CC/SEI-R-10-19/blob/master/work/w08/d1/01-02-uploading-images-django/uploading-images-django.md) to our django lesson on uploading folders if you forgot where to go.
- Note you don't have to make a new one, just confirm your bucket name and write it down!

2. Explore [semantic-ui-react-docs](https://react.semantic-ui.com/)

**Some ideas**

- Setup the a [codepen box to expirement](https://codesandbox.io/dashboard/home?workspace=01ce9485-5fea-436f-9875-c92006a4e04c)

- Setup the getting started, just follow option 1 in the [getting started](https://react.semantic-ui.com/usage) part.

- explore the source code for the layout examples 

- use the [random user api](https://randomuser.me/) and generate a `Card` (from semantic ui) to display the user!

3.  Review the JWT flow again!
